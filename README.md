# Car-Selling-Price-Prediction
# This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing historical car sales data and key features, the model provides a fair price estimation, assisting buyers and sellers in determining competitive pricing.

# What This Project Does
# The Car Selling Price Prediction project utilizes historical data about used car sales to train a predictive model that estimates the price of a used car based on key attributes:
# Make and Model: Brand and model of the car.
# Year: The carâ€™s manufacturing year.
# Mileage: Total distance the car has traveled.
# Engine Size and Fuel Type: Technical specifications that influence car value
# Owner: Who was the owner of car

# Predicting car prices can be challenging. This project offers data-driven price estimates to:
# Save time with quick predictions.
# Reduce price bias in negotiations.
# Help dealerships assess inventory value.

# Getting Started
# 1.Install Dependencies: Use requirements.txt.
# 2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for training.
# 3. Model Training: Test models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
# 4. Make Predictions: Input car details to receive an estimated price.
